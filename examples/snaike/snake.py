class SnakeWorld:
    """
    Represents the snake's world of 40x40 squares. The snake can move
    around the world, eating food and growing longer. The snake's
    position is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple
    represents a segment of the snake's body. The first tuple is the
    head of the snake, and the last tuple is the tail.

    The food is represented as a tuple, indicating its position in the world.

    The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
    The snake's direction is represented as a tuple, where the first item
    is the horizontal direction (-1 for left, 0 for no movement, 1 for right)
    and the second item is the vertical direction (-1 for up, 0 for no
    movement, 1 for down).

    The draw method is not implemented here, as it is expected to be
    implemented in a subclass that handles the rendering of the game.
