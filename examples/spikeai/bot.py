class Bot:
    """
    Represents a simple bot with two motors: left and right. Each motor can
    have a value in the range of: 1 (max forwards), 0 (stopped) or -1
    (max backwards). The bot can move in any direction by adjusting the speed
    and direction of its motors.

    The bot also has two sensors: one to detect colour and the other to detect
    distance. The colour sensor detects one of five possible colours (red, green,
    blue, yellow, or none), while the distance sensor measures the distance to the
    nearest obstacle with six possible ranges (0 [nothing detected], 1 [very
    close], 2 [close], 3 [medium], 4 [far], or 5 [very far]).

    To make the bot useful it should first detect the world using its sensors,
    some sort of computation should be performed to determine the state of the
    bot's motors, and then the motors should be set accordingly.

    For convenience, the bot also provides an `input_layer` method that returns
    a list of inputs to a neural network. This list contains the current colour
    sensor reading and the distance sensor reading, represented as a list of
    floating-point numbers. The first five indices represent the colour sensor
    readings (0 for no colour, 1 for red, 2 for green, 3 for blue, 4 for yellow),
    and the next six indices represent the six possible states for the distance
    sensor reading.
