class Bot:
    """
    Represents a simple bot with two motors: left and right. Each motor can
    have a value in the range of: 1 (max forwards) to 0 (stopped). The bot
    can move in any direction by adjusting the speed of its motors like a
    tank.

    The bot also has a single sensor: to detect distance. The distance sensor
    measures the distance to the nearest obstacle with six possible ranges (0
    [nothing detected], 1 [very close], 2 [close], 3 [medium], 4 [far], or 5
    [very far]).

    To make the bot useful it should first detect the world using its sensor,
    some sort of computation should be performed to determine the state of the
    bot's motors, and then the motors should be set accordingly.

    For convenience, the bot also provides an `input_layer` method that returns
    a list of inputs to a neural network. This list contains the distance
    sensor reading, represented as a list of floating-point numbers. The six
    indices represent the six possible states for the distance sensor reading.
    The index 0 represents no obstacle detected, while index 5 represents an
    obstacle very far away. The active state is represented by a 1.0 in the
    corresponding index, while all other indices are 0.0.
